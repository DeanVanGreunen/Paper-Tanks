Hi there guys, thanks for watching me code for today, its been awesome, and haven't got much to show, except various c# files....

busy with the following

1. getting the weapons, tank, files completed
2. the viewport (basically generating the "paper" underneath and have it slide with the viewport (i'm not going to generate 100s of pages. small maps will be my main focus
3. when this is done, i'll then design the tutorial levels, each will teach the player
various aspects of the game, such as shooting, obsticles.

keyboard bindings will be

left mouse = fire weapon 1
middle mouse = fire weapon 2
right mouse click = fire weapon 3

binds will also include, z, x and c for weapons 1, 2 and 3

plus we will use the arrow keys for movement.
and a extra option to enable the mouse for targeting tanks (last feature)
i'll also add support for console controllers....
