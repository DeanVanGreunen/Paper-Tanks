when working with fill and outline, the outline needs to be 1 less the height for the top, to render correctly
```
canvas.DrawRect(this.progressBoundingBoxRect, progressBoundingBoxPaintFill);
this.progressBoundingBoxRect.Top -= progressBoundingBoxPaintOutlineStrokeWidth;
canvas.DrawRect(this.progressBoundingBoxRect, progressBoundingBoxPaintOutline);
this.progressBoundingBoxRect.Top += progressBoundingBoxPaintOutlineStrokeWidth;
canvas.DrawRect(this.progressBoundingBoxRectLoaded, progressBoundingBoxPaintInner);
```
